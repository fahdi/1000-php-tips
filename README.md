# 1000 PHP Tips

<details><summary>1. Use strict typing with `declare(strict_types=1);`</summary> Enforcing strict typing in PHP helps catch type-related errors during development, resulting in more reliable and predictable code. By declaring `strict_types=1`, PHP will perform strict type checking for function arguments and return types in the file where the declaration is placed.
</details>

<details><summary>2. Prevent SQL injection by using prepared statements with placeholders</summary> When interacting with databases, it is crucial to protect against SQL injection attacks. Prepared statements with placeholders provide a secure way to handle user-supplied data by separating the SQL code from the user input. Prepared statements ensure that input values are treated as data and not executable code, minimizing the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
</details>

<details><summary>3. Avoid using `eval()` as it can be a security risk</summary> The `eval()` function in PHP allows the execution of arbitrary PHP code stored in a string. However, using `eval()` can introduce significant security risks if not used carefully. It can potentially execute malicious code and compromise the application's integrity. It is generally recommended to find alternative solutions instead of relying on `eval()`.
</details>

<details><summary>4. Use `foreach` instead of `for` loop when iterating over an array</summary> The `foreach` loop provides a convenient way to iterate over arrays in PHP. Unlike the `for` loop, which requires manual indexing and length checks, `foreach` automatically iterates over each element of an array without the need for explicit index management. This simplifies the code and reduces the chance of off-by-one errors.
</details>

<details><summary>5. Escape output using `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks</summary> Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when untrusted data is displayed on a web page without proper sanitization. By using the `htmlspecialchars()` function, special characters in the output are converted to their HTML entities, preventing the browser from interpreting them as code. This helps protect against XSS vulnerabilities and ensures that user-supplied data is displayed safely.
</details>

<details><summary>6. Use `trim()` to remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string</summary> The `trim()` function in PHP is useful for removing leading and trailing whitespace characters from a string. This is particularly helpful when dealing with user input, as it ensures that any accidental spaces or tabs are excluded, allowing for consistent and reliable data processing.
</details>

<details><summary>7. Use `filter_var()` to validate and sanitize user input</summary> Validating and sanitizing user input is essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing security vulnerabilities. PHP's `filter_var()` function provides a simple and effective way to validate various types of input, such as email addresses, URLs, and integers. It also offers options for sanitizing input, removing potentially harmful or unwanted characters.
</details>

<details><summary>8. Use `array_map()` to apply a callback function to every element of an array</summary> `array_map()` is a versatile function that allows you to apply a callback function to each element of an array. This can be useful for performing transformations or calculations on array values without the need for explicit loop constructs. The result is a new array containing the modified elements, leaving the original array unchanged.
</details>

<details><summary>9. Utilize `array_key_exists()` to check if a key exists in an array</summary> When working with arrays, it is often necessary to check if a specific key exists.

By providing the target substring, the replacement substring, and the input string, you can obtain the modified result.
</details>

<details><summary>11. Use `sprintf()` for string formatting and interpolation</summary> `sprintf()` is a powerful function for formatting strings in PHP. It allows you to specify placeholders in a format string and replace them with corresponding values. This can be useful for constructing dynamic strings with variables, numbers, or other data types, providing control over the formatting and arrangement of the output.
</details>

<details><summary>12. Avoid using the `global` keyword; prefer dependency injection</summary> The `global` keyword allows access to global variables within the local scope of a function or method. However, using global variables can make code harder to understand, test, and maintain. Prefer dependency injection, where dependencies are explicitly passed into functions or classes, making the code more modular, reusable, and easier to manage.
</details>

<details><summary>13. Use `date()` or `DateTime` for handling dates and times</summary> PHP provides `date()` and `DateTime` for working with dates and times. `date()` allows you to format the current date or a specified timestamp, while `DateTime` provides an object-oriented approach for manipulating and formatting dates. These functions offer a wide range of options for customizing the display and calculation of dates and times.
